### Flight Cancellation Prediction
<https://github.com/corkreng/Data-Science-Projects/tree/343963b887fd2b1f453b59ed6809f221de40957b/Flight_cancellation>

 This Project was a combined final project of two different classes during my Master's. The project was to be done in SAS enterprise miner and SAS programming with a three-person group. It was a group project for which I was solely responsible for SAS programming. It included joins using different foreign keys, summary tables, data cleaning, and thorough analysis of variables to determine if they should be included in the modeling process. I identified a strong class imbalance and created a modified sample which split the data into 50% canceled flights and %50 non-canceled flights and set the prior probability with SAS enterprise miner. I assisted Chloe in the modeling within SAS Enterprise Miner but most of the credit goes to her. The PowerPoint and written report was collaborative, but most of the credit goes to Will.
  
### Diabetes Survey Prediction

  This project was initial done for the annual SAS cup competition during my Master's with the help of Will Davis. I lost the code original code, but have redone it in python and with different models and methods. 

### Dashboard of Presidential Elections

  This project was done through the use of tableau to show data visualization of previous presidential elections from 1976 to 2020. 

### Groundwater Forecasting
<https://github.com/corkreng/Data-Science-Projects/tree/fef1ce48c4ba765be2421ca251e606553f94dcd1/GroundWater_forecast>

 This project was done for a consulting class where I consulted the geological survey of Alabama on a time series analysis project. The data given to me was a daily measurement of the height of the water level in a well in Tuscaloosa County. I was tasked with answering a few questions regarding the trend, seasonality, and forecasting.
