### Flight Cancellation Prediction
<https://github.com/corkreng/Data-Science-Projects/tree/343963b887fd2b1f453b59ed6809f221de40957b/Flight_cancellation>

 This Project was a combined final project of two different classes during my Master's. The project was to be done in SAS enterprise miner and SAS programming with a three-person group. It was a group project for which I was solely responsible for SAS programming and exporlatory data analysis. It included joins using different foreign keys, summary tables, data cleaning, and thorough analysis of variables to determine if they should be included in the modeling process. I identified a strong class imbalance and created a modified sample which split the data into 50% canceled flights and %50 non-canceled flights and set the prior probability with SAS enterprise miner. I assisted in the modeling within SAS Enterprise Miner.
  
### Diabetes Survey Prediction
<https://github.com/corkreng/Data-Science-Projects/tree/4b3a35310f78e3d57d4e0a1dc991dd6a502c254c/diabetes_prediction>

  This project was initially created to detected diabetes in individuals that maybe unaware or likely to have diabetes. With the use of survey data and questions I created a predictive model that can be put into production by answering the survey questions and recieving the predicted response. Many models were tried with the logistic regression and deep learning models tying in f1-score as well as recall and precision. The logistic regression was choosen as the final model due to its intrpretuerability and lower number of input variables. The final model will be deployed on a website that I am currently working on. 

### Dashboard of Presidential Elections

  This project was done through the use of tableau to show data visualization of previous presidential elections from 1976 to 2020. The dashboard displays results for each state and year specified. 

### Groundwater Forecasting

 This project was done for a consulting class where I consulted the geological survey of Alabama on a time series analysis project. The data given to me was a daily measurement of the height of the water level in a well in Tuscaloosa County. I was tasked with answering a few questions regarding the trend, seasonality, rain as an external regressor, and forecasting. All the project was done in R with the use of forecast and dplyr libraries. Decomposition showed no trend and showed seasonality having big impact on the times series data. The auto arima function was applied with the external regressor and feature engineered variants of it which produced a lower validation MASE score than the naive forecast. It suffered from non constant variance in the winter period. In an attempt to address this other external variables assocaited was the winter season, temperture and wind speed, were tried. All models suffered from non constant variance where the variance and residuals of the models increased in the winter period. All external regressors were statistically significant but more analysis need to be done create a more statistically accurate model. 

## Tic-Tac-Toe

 This project was done my senior year of undergrad when we skipped a chapter in the statistics textbook for the class. The chapter we skipped was the Mini-Max algorythm which I taugh myself and made a Tic-Tac-Toe game with. It was originally made in C++ but has since been swithed over to python where I plan on learning and developing Monte carlo tree search and deep Q-learning algorithms for the game.
